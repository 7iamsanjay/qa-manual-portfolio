#  QA Manual Testing Portfolio

This repository showcases my practical skills in **manual software testing**, including:

- ✅ Test Case Design (Positive & Negative)
- ✅ Bug Reporting (JIRA/Azure Dev-Ops style format)
- ✅ Test Plans and Test Scenarios
- ✅ Defect Life Cycle & STLC understanding
- ✅ API Manual Testing (Optional)

All examples are based on real-world test scenarios using demo applications (e.g., e-commerce login, user registration, etc.).
